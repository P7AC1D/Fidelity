# Fidelity Engine
My personal OpenGL based 3D rendering engine to learn and implement graphics algorithms and optimisations.

## Features
- Deferred Rendering Pipeline
- Cascaded Shadow Maps for Directional Lights
- Scenegraph with Frustrum Culling
- Editor UI for Debugging

## Images
![Sponza Scene](/Resources/Screenshots/sponza_1.png, "Sponza 1")

## Future Work
- [x] Cascaded Shadow Maps for Directional Lights
- [x] Soft Shadows using Poisson disc sampling and PCF
- [ ] Point Light Shadow Maps
- [x] Screen space ambient occlusion
- [ ] Screen space reflection
- [ ] Motion Blur
- [ ] Depth of Field
- [ ] FXAA
- [ ] HDR Tone Mapping
- [ ] Physically based rendering
- [ ] Clustered Shading
