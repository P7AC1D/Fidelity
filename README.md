## Building

### Prerequisites
- **CMake 3.21 or higher** - [Download from cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download/)
- **Visual Studio 2019 or later** (on Windows) with C++ development tools
- **Git** for cloning the repository and submodules

### Clone with Submodules
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/your-username/Fidelity.git
cd Fidelity
```

If you already cloned without `--recursive`, initialize submodules:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Windows Build Instructions

#### Option 1: Using the Build Script (Recommended)
The easiest way to build on Windows is using the provided PowerShell script:

```powershell
# From the project root directory
.\build-windows.ps1
```

This script will:
- Create a `build/release` directory
- Configure CMake with Release settings
- Build all targets
- Copy resources to the output directory

#### Option 2: Manual CMake Build
If you prefer to build manually or need custom configuration:

```powershell
# Create and enter build directory
mkdir build\release
cd build\release

# Configure with CMake
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\..

# Build the project
cmake --build . --config Release

# Copy resources (optional, for running examples)
cmake --build . --target copy_resources --config Release
```

### Build Options

The CMake build system supports several configuration options:

- `FIDELITY_ENABLE_WARNINGS` (Default: ON) - Enable comprehensive compiler warnings
- `FIDELITY_BUILD_TESTS` (Default: ON) - Build unit test executables
- `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` - Build configuration: Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, MinSizeRel

Example with custom options:
```powershell
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DFIDELITY_ENABLE_WARNINGS=OFF ..\..
```

### Application Targets

After building, you'll find several executable applications in the `build/release/bin/Release/` directory:

- **Test3D** (`build/release/bin/Release/Test3D.exe`)  
  Basic 3D rendering test with primitive shapes and basic lighting

- **Sponza** (`build/release/bin/Release/Sponza.exe`)  
  Comprehensive scene demonstration featuring the classic Sponza atrium with full PBR pipeline

- **CullingTest** (`build/release/bin/Release/CullingTest.exe`)  
  Frustum culling performance demonstration with large numbers of objects

- **Tests** (`build/release/bin/Release/Tests.exe`)  
  Comprehensive unit test suite for engine mathematics and core systems

All applications include the editor UI for real-time parameter adjustment and debugging.

### Running the Applications

You can run the applications from the project root directory:

```powershell
# Run the Sponza demo (most comprehensive)
.\build\release\bin\Release\Sponza.exe

# Run the basic 3D test
.\build\release\bin\Release\Test3D.exe

# Run the culling performance test
.\build\release\bin\Release\CullingTest.exe

# Run the unit tests
.\build\release\bin\Release\Tests.exe
```

Or navigate to the executable directory and run them directly:

```powershell
cd build\release\bin\Release
.\Sponza.exe
```

**Note**: All required resources (shaders, textures, models, fonts) are automatically copied to the executable directory during the build process, so the applications will find all necessary assets regardless of how they are launched.

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

- **CMake version error**: Ensure CMake 3.21+ is installed and in PATH
- **Missing submodules**: Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` 
- **Visual Studio not found**: Install Visual Studio 2019+ with "C++ CMake tools" workload
- **OpenGL errors**: Update graphics drivers; ensure OpenGL 4.1+ support
- **Build errors**: Try a clean build by deleting `build/` directory and rebuilding
- **Runtime crashes**: Verify all resources are copied; check console for OpenGL errors
- **Poor performance**: Ensure Release build; check GPU compatibility

**Debug Build Performance**: Debug builds include extensive validation and may run significantly slower than Release builds.

## Technical Requirements

### Minimum System Requirements
- **OS**: Windows 10+ or macOS 10.14+
- **Graphics**: OpenGL 4.1 compatible GPU
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended

## Architecture Overview

Fidelity Engine follows a modular, component-based architecture designed for extensibility and maintainability. The engine is structured around several key subsystems:

### Core Architecture Components

**Application Layer**: The main application framework handles window management, input processing, and the primary game loop.

**Scene Management**: A hierarchical scene graph system manages game objects, transforms, and spatial relationships.

**Rendering Pipeline**: A deferred rendering pipeline optimized for physically-based rendering (PBR) with multiple render passes.

**Resource Management**: Efficient loading and management of textures, models, shaders, and other assets.

**Mathematics Library**: Custom mathematics implementation for 3D graphics operations.

### Rendering Pipeline

The engine implements a modern deferred rendering pipeline with the following stages:

1. **Geometry Pass**: Renders scene geometry to G-buffer
2. **Shadow Pass**: Generates cascaded shadow maps for directional lights
3. **Lighting Pass**: Performs physically-based lighting calculations
4. **Post-Processing**: Applies SSAO, bloom, tone mapping, and other effects
5. **Forward Pass**: Handles transparent objects and UI elements
